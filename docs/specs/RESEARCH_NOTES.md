## 1. Doc templates (PRD / RFC / design docs)
- RFCs/design docs clarify assumptions early; teams that write + review them ship
  more maintainable architecture. Keep ≤5–7 pages, use diagrams, name 3–5 reviewers,
  ~2-week deadline.
- Common RFC structure (Tanya Reilly / *Staff Engineer's Path*): Status/Author/Dates ·
  Goals (+ "why") · Background · **Alternatives considered** · Trade-offs/disadvantages.
  Omitting alternatives = signal the problem wasn't thought through.
- PRD sections: Problem/Opportunity · Personas · **Goals + Non-Goals** · Success
  metrics (KPIs, launch criteria) · Features (**MoSCoW**) · Non-functional reqs.
- Failure mode: too much detail better suited to code than doc review → keep concise.

## 2. Pickleball / sports court detection & homography
- Pipelines combine **YOLO detection + keypoint detection + homography**. YOLOv8 for
  players/ball; a fine-tuned **ResNet50** improves court keypoint precision.
- Detected court keypoints → **3×3 homography matrix H** maps image points `p` to a
  top-down "mini-court" `p'` (`p' = H·p`), giving real court-relative positions.
- Court detection: classic **Hough-line** + homography, or modern ResNet50 keypoint
  model (robust across court types/angles).
- Outputs analytics: heatmaps, rally tempo, kitchen-zone usage.

## 3. Action recognition (shot/event classification)
- Core challenge: fuse **spatial + temporal** features; sports events are brief
  (frame-level precision), with occlusion + rapid motion.
- Tasks: **Temporal Action Localization (TAL)** (segments), **Action Spotting (AS)**
  (representative timestamp), **Precise Event Spotting (PES)** (exact frame).
- Model families: 2D, 3D (e.g. I3D), two/multi-stream, **skeleton-based** (pose).
  Football example: I3D + TSN + pose estimation.
- 2025 SOTA threads: Evolved Parallel Recurrent Net (EPRN) + wavelets; Adaptive
  Spatio-Temporal Refinement (ASTRM).

## 4. Tracking — ByteTrack, ID switches, ReID
- **ByteTrack**: associates *every* detection box (incl. low-confidence) in a 2nd
  stage → robust to occlusion/appearance dips. Fast, IoU + motion based.
- **Limitation:** ID switches in crowded/overlapping scenes (IoU can't disambiguate
  close tracklets); IDs swap when players cross.
- **Fixes:** add **ReID** (appearance embeddings) — BoT-SORT / DeepSORT; **EIoU** in
  ByteTrack's 2nd association; occlusion recovery (e.g. SAM appearance). Sport priors
  (fixed 2/4 players, court halves) further disambiguate.

## 5. Ball tracking (small/fast object) — TrackNet
- IoU/nearest fails on fast small ball. **TrackNet** outputs a per-frame heatmap from
  a 3-frame window (VGG16-style encoder + DeconvNet upsampling). V3 adds trajectory
  rectification; pretrained weights exist; pickleball transfer demonstrated.

## 6. Pretrained pickleball detectors (Roboflow Universe)
- GameChangerv1 (YOLOv8; classes PB/Paddle/ball/player), ak-zcxgt (YOLOv11, mAP 65.4),
  Liberin pickleball-vision (hosted API). Drop into Ultralytics via `DETECTOR_MODEL`
  or use Roboflow `inference` SDK.

## 7. AWS — async LLM + GPU video architecture
- Standard async-ingest: **S3 → SQS → Lambda/worker** buffers requests; reliable
  decoupling. **Bedrock batch inference** is the cost-efficient path for large async
  volumes (CreateModelInvocationJob, JSONL).
- **Model routing:** switch Claude **Sonnet ↔ Haiku** to optimize cost/latency per
  call type. Invoke via `invoke_model` (+ streaming variant).
- Bedrock has no GPU video step — pair with **EC2 GPU / SageMaker** for frame
  processing, then send structured results/captions to Claude.

## How these informed the design
- **Court homography** → RFC-001 fusion stage (real-unit positions; fixes pixel-space
  coaching gap). Plan: YOLO/ResNet50 keypoints + 3×3 H.
- **Action TAL/AS/PES + skeleton models** → action-classifier design (v1 heuristic stub).
- **ByteTrack ID-switch + ReID/EIoU** → tracking risk + mitigation in RFC-001.
- **TrackNet** → ball-every-frame backend (don't hold-last the ball).
- **AWS S3→SQS + Bedrock Haiku routing** → DELIVERY_PLAN AWS topology + cost controls.
