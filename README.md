## 📖 Overview

This project utilizes video analysis and LLM-based summarization to extract performance insights from Pickleball matches. It uses a multimodal pipeline that integrates player tracking, pose estimation, event detection, and coaching tip generation.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎥 Ingest videos from YouTube links or local storage
- 🧍‍♂️ Player detection & tracking with bounding boxes
- 🕴️ Pose estimation for strokes and footwork
- 📊 Action and shot classification (e.g., serve, volley, drop shot)
- 🧠 Feedback generation via LLMs (e.g., "Improve your foot positioning during serves")
- 🔁 Auto-coaching loop: track, analyze, suggest
- 📁 Session-based feedback history
