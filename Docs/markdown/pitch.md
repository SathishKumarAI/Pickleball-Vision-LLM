# Project Pickleball V Couch

### üîπ 30-Second Pitch (For Quick Conversations or Networking)

> *"Project Pickleball V Couch is building an AI coaching assistant for pickleball. We‚Äôre using computer vision to analyze matches and large language models to give players personalized, real-time feedback‚Äîjust like a virtual coach. Since no pickleball dataset exists, we‚Äôre creating one from scratch with YouTube video footage, fine-tuning models like YOLOv8 and Llama-2, and optimizing the pipeline to run on GPUs. It‚Äôs sports analytics reimagined for everyone‚Äîfrom hobbyists to high-performers."*

### üìä Investor-Style Deck Intro (Slide 1 or Voiceover)

> *‚ÄúPickleball is the fastest-growing sport in the U.S.‚Äîbut there‚Äôs no smart training solution yet. Project Pickleball V Couch is the first AI assistant that watches your game and tells you how to improve. By combining computer vision and language models, we analyze real match videos, track player behavior, and deliver coaching advice in natural language. With a scalable, modular pipeline and our own proprietary dataset, we‚Äôre building the next frontier of sports intelligence‚Äîstarting with pickleball.‚Äù*

### üßæ Startup Grant Abstract (Formal Use - Research, Funding Proposals)

Project **Pickleball V Couch** aims to develop an AI-powered coaching system tailored for pickleball, leveraging multimodal learning through computer vision and natural language processing. In the absence of existing datasets, we will curate a domain-specific dataset using publicly available match footage. 

Our end-to-end pipeline includes:

- Object detection  
- Player tracking  
- Pose estimation  
- Coaching feedback generation using large language models  

This solution democratizes access to advanced training insights for athletes, coaches, and enthusiasts alike. The system is built on open-source technologies and optimized for GPU acceleration to support real-time deployment in both consumer and professional settings.
