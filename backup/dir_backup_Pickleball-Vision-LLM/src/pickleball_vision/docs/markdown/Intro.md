## 02. Vision & Objectives

### Vision
To build an AI-powered virtual pickleball coach that understands gameplay from raw video, provides actionable feedback to players, and scales personalized coaching to thousands of users‚Äîenabling smarter, data-driven training for the modern athlete.

### Long-Term Objectives

**Objective 1:**  
Develop a robust, modular pipeline that can process raw pickleball match videos into structured gameplay insights using open-source vision and language models.

**Objective 2:**  
Enable real-time or near-real-time inference and feedback by optimizing models with ONNX, TensorRT, and GPU acceleration.

**Objective 3:**  
Create a multimodal assistant capable of interpreting gameplay context and generating strategic advice using fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) integrated with visual perception.

### Roadmap Alignment
Each component in this roadmap directly supports the long-term vision of an intelligent, scalable coaching system:

- The vision pipeline (YOLOv8, SAM, MediaPipe) enables structured scene understanding ‚Äî critical for providing accurate feedback.  
- The LLM layer translates visual data into strategic insights, unlocking the power of natural language as an interface.  
- By focusing on modular architecture and optimization, the project becomes deployable on consumer hardware, expanding access to users at all levels of play.  

Aligning with company goals in innovation and personalization, this roadmap positions **Project Pickleball V Couch** as a flagship for smart sports analytics.
